D. Discuss a visual effect (10 pts)
Take a screenshot (or photo) of an interesting visual effect you noticed in a video game or
computational artwork. In a few paragraphs, describe the effect. What do you like about it?
How do you think it was created? Does the effect change depending on the camera view?
The lights? Is it an effect that updates the geometry itself, or change the color of the pixels,
or does it alter a texture?

The visual effect that intrigues me the most are the sweat and reflection effects that are placed
onto the players in NBA2K. The effect seems to reflect away ligh from certain angles, and only if certain
amount of restrictions are met. In this photo, you can clearly see the player sweating with white light effects
reflecting off of his black skin. This creates a realistic look towards the players.

This effect was created mostly likely through a similar technique as what we learned in three.js. It's much
more complicated than say mirroring through a box, but the root techniques shouldn't be that much different. 
The shine of the light as it is reflected off the sweat makes for a very realistic game photo. If you were to
change view points, the light would still most likely be reflected from a actual light source point. I think 
the effect appliesthe sweat texture on the character and the texture is just changed from that point. These
effects are what makes games like 2kmore enjoyable since it immerses the player into the a semi-realistic environment.
